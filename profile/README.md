# Scikit-TDA

Scikit-TDA is a home for Topological Data Analysis libraries in python. Our intention is 
to help non-topologists get started and gain intuition with a variety of notebooks and tutorials. 
Our aim is to provide a library of TDA tools in python that are widely useable and easily approachable.

## Libraries

Scikit-TDA consists of a variety of packages with efficient and optimzied implementations of commonly used TDA algorithms.
- [ripser.py](https://github.com/scikit-tda/ripser.py): A lean persistent homology library for python based on [ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser).
- [kepler-mapper](https://github.com/scikit-tda/kepler-mapper): A flexible python implementation of the Mapper algorithm.
- [persim](https://github.com/scikit-tda/persim): Distances and representations of persistence diagrams.
- [cechmate](https://github.com/scikit-tda/cechmate): Custom filtration constructors for python.
- [tadasets](https://github.com/scikit-tda/tadasets): Synthetic datasets for TDA benchmarking and exploration.
